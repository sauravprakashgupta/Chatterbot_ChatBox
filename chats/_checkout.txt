Did you enjoy your stay with us?
Yes, very much so. However, I now need to get to the airport. I have a flight that leaves in about two hours, so what is the quickest way to get there?
We do have a free airport shuttle service.
That sounds great, but will it get me to the airport on time?
Yes, it should. The next shuttle leaves in 15 minutes, and it takes approximately 25 minutes to get to the airport.
Fantastic. I'll just wait in the lounge area. Will you please let me know when it will be leaving?
Of course, sir. Oh, before you go would you be able to settle the mini-bar bill?
Oh yes certainly. How much will that be?
Let's see. The bill comes to $37.50. How would you like to pay for that?
I'll pay with my Visa thanks, but I'll need a receipt so I can charge it to my company.
Absolutely. Here we are sir. If you like you can leave your bags with the porter and he can load them onto the shuttle for you when it arrives.
That would be great thank you.
Would you like to sign the hotel guestbook too while you wait?
Sure, I had a really good stay here and I'll tell other people to come here.
That's good to hear. Thank you again for staying at The Grand Woodward Hotel.
