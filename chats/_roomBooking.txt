I would like to book a room
Good morning Sir. May I help you?
Good morning. I need a room.
Do you require a single or double room or a suite?
Well! A single room will do.
Please fill your name in this register.
May I know the tariff please?
It's nine hundred rupees a day.
Does it include breakfast?
No sir. It's just for the accommodation sir.
Is the room air conditioned?
All our rooms are centrally air-conditioned.
Do you have a restaurant?
Not one. We have three. We offer Indian, Western and Chinese cuisine catered by the different restaurants.
Well! That's good news. I can choose different cuisine for different meals.
May I know the duration of your stay?
Oh! I haven't filled that column because I haven't decided on my period of stay yet. It all depends on how early or how late I am going to finish my work. But, tentatively, I shall write it as four days.
That'll do. Please inform us about your extension one day earlier.
Sure. By the way, do you have laundry facility here?
Yes. Please call up the housekeeping department and they will have the clothes picked up.
How do I get the extension phone numbers for all the departments?
All the in-house phone numbers are in a list kept near the telephone.
Oh! That will do. Thank you. You have been very helpful.
My pleasure! I am here to help you.
Thanks. Well I am rather tired. Can you please ask the bellboy to bring my luggage to the room?
Certainly. Here's your key.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
